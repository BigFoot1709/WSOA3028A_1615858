                <em>A URL (a Uniform Resource Locator) is an address of any given resource that could be found on the
                    Web.
                    Every unique URL will point to its own unique resource, those being resources such as HTML pages, a
                    figure or a document for example. The organization of resources required for a website is needed for
                    the
                    design of simple URLs that can be read or even memorized so that anyone can type in them into a
                    browser’s URL bar to get to the resource they require with ease. Organized URLs will also clarify
                    the
                    reading and the interaction with the resources for both the users and the developers of the
                    website.</em>
            </p>
            <h3>Semantic URL Design</h3>
            <p>
                For this created website a semantic type design is taken for the organization and naming of the URLs due
                to its technical and logical approach. The URL paths are named consistency throughout the all the
                top-level file, sections files, sub-sections files and web pages. The general naming convention for this
                website follows the one written below:
            </p>
            <p>
                https://bigfoot1709.github.io/TOP-LEVEL/SECTION/SUB-SECTION/PAGE
            </p>
            <h4>Top-level</h4>
            <p>
                The top-level directory called “WSOA3028A_1615858” servers as the file that holds all the subsequent
                resources. In it only one page resides that being the home page called “index.html”.
            </p>
            <h4>Sections</h4>
            <p>
                Files found within the top-level directory leading to the different sections of the website’s navigation
                tabs. So far as seen there are 3 Sections on the navigation tab above – About, Blogs and Contact. Each
                section file servers for one of these tabs where resources needed for the tabs will be found inside.
            </p>
            <h4>Sub-sections</h4>
            <p>

            </p>
            <h4>Pages</h4>
            <p>
