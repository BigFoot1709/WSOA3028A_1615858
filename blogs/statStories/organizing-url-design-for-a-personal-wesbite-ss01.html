                <em>A URL (a Uniform Resource Locator) is an address of any given resource that could be found on the
                    Web.
                    Every unique URL will point to its own unique resource, those being resources such as HTML pages, a
                    figure or a document for example. The organization of resources required for a website is needed for
                    the
                    design of simple URLs that can be read or even memorized so that anyone can type in them into a
                    browser’s URL bar to get to the resource they require with ease. Organized URLs will also clarify
                    the
                    reading and the interaction with the resources for both the users and the developers of the
                    website.</em>
            </p>
            <h3>Semantic URL Design</h3>
            <p>
                For this created website a semantic type design is taken for the organization and naming of the URLs due
                to its technical and logical approach. The URL paths are named consistency throughout the all the
                top-level file, sections files, sub-sections files and web pages. The general naming convention for this
                website follows the one written below:
            </p>
            <p align="center"><strong>
                    https://bigfoot1709.github.io/TOP-LEVEL/SECTION/SUB-SECTION/PAGE</strong>
            </p>
            <h4>Top-level</h4>
            <p>
                The top-level directory called “WSOA3028A_1615858” servers as the file that holds all the subsequent
                resources. In it only one page resides that being the home page called “index.html”.
            </p>
            <p align="center"><strong>
                    https://bigfoot1709.github.io/WSOA3028A_1615858/index.html</strong>
            </p>
            <h4>Sections</h4>
            <p>
                Files found within the top-level directory leading to the different sections of the website’s navigation
                tabs. So far as seen there are 3 Sections on the navigation tab above – About, Blogs and Contact. Each
                section file servers for one of these tabs where resources needed for the tabs will be found inside.
                Names of the main navigation tabs’ paths are lower cased without hyphens or underscores (about, blogs,
                contact) for shorter path length and to make for a clear and simple read. An example of the “Blogs”
                section would have the following path:
            </p>
            <p align="center"><strong>
                    https://bigfoot1709.github.io/WSOA3028A_1615858/blogs</strong>
            </p>
            <h4>Sub-sections</h4>
            <p>
                Sub-sections are the second-level files found within the section files. For example, the “Blogs” section
                will have 2 types of blogs being written: Theory blogs written by Devan Gray for his coursework on
                WSOA3028A and Stats blogs written by myself, Steven Stat, about the latest sports news and stats
                happening at the 2007 T20 Cricket World Cup. Therefore 2 sub-section files will be found in the Blogs
                file. The names for these sub-sections will be continuous strings with capitalized words – with the
                first word being lower case. An example of one of these sub-sections is written below:
            </p>
            <p align="center"><strong>
                    https://bigfoot1709.github.io/WSOA3028A_1615858/blogs/theoryBlogs</strong>
            </p>
            <h4>Pages</h4>
            <p>
                The page on the “About” web page of this personal website will have the following URL path name:
            </p>
            <p align="center"><strong>
                    https://bigfoot1709.github.io/WSOA3028A_1615858/about/steven-stat-about.html</strong>
            </p>
            <p>
                Blog post pages will have the title of the post as the page name in lower case with hyphens in between
                words as well as a blog code to show the blogs’ number in order of the series of the blogs – blog01
                being the first blog written. For example, the page that will display this blog post about URL design
                will have the following:
            </p>
            <p align="center"><strong>
