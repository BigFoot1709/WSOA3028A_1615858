                <h4>The Warm-Up</h4>
                <p>
                    A journey into the unknow for players and fans alike, the first match of the first World Twenty20.
                    Going into the game, South Africa had played 5 such games of the new format and West Indies only 3 –
                    something you would not expect after seeing the result of the World Cup opener.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Tonight’s World Cup opening match in Johannesburg started with <a
                        href="https://www.espncricinfo.com/westindies/content/player/51880.html" target="_blank">Chris
                        Gayle’s</a>
                    blazing 117 run century – the first century ever scored in the
                    new Twenty20 format of the game – that looked to lock in the West Indies as sure winners. But was
                    not the case as a quick fire 90 from <a
                        href="https://www.espncricinfo.com/southafrica/content/player/45224.html"
                        target="_blank">Herschelle Gibbs</a>, helped with some poor fielding and
                    bowling,
                    helped see South Africa home with 2 whole overs to spare. West Indies dropped 3 catches and bowled a
                    record breaking 23 wides that didn’t do them any good.

                <h4>The Match</h4>
                <p>
                    Chris Gayle and <a href="https://www.espncricinfo.com/westindies/content/player/52962.html"
                        target="_blank">Devon Smith’s</a> mammoth opening partnership of 145, off just 82 balls, was
                    certainly
                    the main factor that got the West Indies innings underway and saw them to a grand total of 205
                    runs
                    for 6 wickets. But no other partnerships seemed to stand out in the same innings with the next
                    highest only being 26 runs. South Africa’s bowlers’ ability to take wickets at regular intervals
                    after the opening partnership definitely saves them from having to chase something like 250+
                    runs.
                    This would be something the West Indies bowlers did not execute during South Africa’s innings
                    with
                    South Africa producing 3 healthy partnerships of 54, 34 and 120*. The key to any successful run
                    chase in any format of cricket is keeping wickets in hand and that's exactly what South Africa
                    did
                    during their innings.

                <h4>The Stats - Gayle vs Gibbs</h4>
                <p>
                    It has to be said that both Gayle and Gibb’s innings were outstanding, and nothing can be taken away
                    from them. That said there has to be a better innings, one has the out best the other in some way.
                    Yes Gayle’s inning was way faster than Gibbs’, 25% faster to be exact, but it is understandable as
                    Gayle was setting a total – he didn’t know what a good total who be on that pitch in Johannesburg
                    tonight so he gave it his all and pushed for every run he could give. While that being said, I think
                    Gibbs’ innings was slower as he was being more calculated in his decisions - when to accelerate,
                    when to see off certain bowlers that were bowling accurately or when to rotate strike to batsmen
                    that were hitting the ball well such as <a
                        href="https://www.espncricinfo.com/southafrica/content/player/45797.html" target="_blank">Justin
                        Kemp</a> was with his quick fire 46 runs off 22 balls
                    with a whopping strike rate of 209. Gayle saw to accelerate at all times, and it came off, does not
                    always but it did tonight, and he was rewarded. Gibbs did exactly what was needed for the successful
                    run chase and that was keeping his wicket intact and seeing that he stayed in throughout South
                    African’s entire innings while still keeping with the run rate. He did that by playing safer and hit
                    the ball along the ground for a lot more fours then Gayle did. I would say Gibbs’ not out innings of
                    90 runs was the better innings as it was smarter and more calculating as he had to adapted it
                    throughout its time. Who knows, if West Indies got more runs Gibbs might have chased them down too
                    and scored his century too.
