                <h4>The Warm-Up</h4>
                <p>
                    Tournament favourites, Sri Lanka, stocked with well-known players full of talent all-round made a
                    statement against Kenya in Johannesburg on Friday morning. With a record breaking 260 runs in their
                    20 overs Sri Lanka saw themselves to a massive 172 run victory after bowling Kenya out for an
                    abysmal score off 88 all out.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It was definitely a batsmen’s game this morning with Sri Lanka’s innings seeing contributions from
                    Jayasuriya, Jayawardene and Mubarak each scoring big scores at more then 2 runs a ball. Sangakkara
                    also chipped in with a moderately quick 30 off 18 balls to help the cause. On a day where runs were
                    flowing as easily as ever the other batsmen surly felt they must have missed out.

                <h4>The Match</h4>
                <p>
                    Sri Lanka’s two strong partnerships during the 2nd and 3rd wicket (of Jayasuriya/Sangakkara and
                    Jayasuriya/Jayawardene respectively) as well as the blitz score from Mubarak at the end of the
                    innings was definitely the cause of Sri Lanka’s record-breaking success. Kenya’s bowls could not
                    keep the scoring down below 12 for the majority of the whole innings. Lameck Onyango going for 61
                    runs in his 4 overs (that is 15.25 runs per over – a strike rate of 254!) as well as Odhiambo and
                    Ongondo going for 57 and 53 respectively in theirs. In Kenya’s innings no fight was shown as half
                    the side was back in the pavilion with the score on 50. Chaminda Vaas demonstrated the right line
                    and length to bowl on the pitch going for just 15 runs off his 4 over (a run rate of just 3.75) as
                    well as picking up the 2 opening wickets of the innings.

                <h4>The Stats - StatFacts</h4>

                <p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Sri Lanka's total of 260 for 8 is the highest total in a Twenty20 international, beating the
                            previous
                            best of 221 for 5 made by Australia against England earlier this year in 2007.
                        </li>
                        <li>Kenya could only manage 88 runs when it was their turn to bat, handing Sri Lanka a 172-run
                            win, the biggest margin of victory (by runs) in a Twenty20 international.
                        </li>
                        <li>Sri Lanka's total was boosted by 30 fours, the best till now in a Twenty20 international,
                            ahead of the 24 hit by South Africa in the inaugural match of the tournament. 186 runs came
                            in fours and sixes, the highest by far in a Twenty20 international.
                        </li>
                        <li>Jehan Mubarak scored 29 runs off an over from Lameck Onyango, one run behind the highest of
                            30 runs that Ricky Ponting made off Daryl Tuffey in Auckland.
                        </li>
                        <li>For the first time in a Twenty20 international, three bowlers conceded more than 50 runs in
                            an innings. Onyango, Nehemiah Odhiambo and Peter Ongondo were the bowlers who suffered,
                            giving away 61, 57 and 53 runs.
                        </li>
                        <li>Mahela Jayawardene got to his fifty off 21 balls, the second-fastest after Mohammad
                            Ashraful, who took 20 balls for his fifty in the match against West Indies. However, his 65
                            off 27 balls ensured he powered his way to the top of the strike-rate charts in Twenty20
                            internationals.
                        </li>
                        <li>Mubarak nearly got to the fastest fifty himself, having scored 46 off 13 balls. Mubarak's
                            strike-rate of 353.84 is the second-highest strike-rate in an innings (minimum 25 runs)
                            behind Dwayne Smith's 29 off seven balls against Bangladesh.
                        </li>
                        <li>With his 44-ball 88, Sanath Jayasuriya leads the batting averages in Twenty20 matches,
                            averaging 90 runs per innings.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
