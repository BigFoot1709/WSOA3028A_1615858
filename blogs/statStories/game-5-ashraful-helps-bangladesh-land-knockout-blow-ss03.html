                <h4>The Warm-Up</h4>
                <p>
                    The team that set the tournament opener on fire, West Indies, sent home on Thursday afternoon after
                    some good bowling and even better batting from the underdogs Bangladesh as make a chase of 164 look
                    easy as ever.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Bangladesh’s ability to take West Indian wickets at regular intervals definitely saved them from
                    having to chase a much larger total in this afternoon’s game. West Indies being the first team to
                    exit the tournament much have felt they really missed out having played both their games at the
                    wonderful cricket stadium to score huge totals that is Wanderers.

                <h4>The Match</h4>
                <p>
                    It all began with Syed Rasel getting the surprised wicket of Chris Gayle out for a duck on just the
                    3rd ball of the match, a ready shock for the West Indian team it seemed. From there Devon Smith and
                    Shivnarine Chanderpaul seemed to steady the ship at a very slow rate, courtesy of the very
                    economical bowling of Rasel and Abdur Razzak, with a partnership of 95 of 79 balls at a strike rate
                    of just 120. More quick wickets disturbed the flow of the West Indians’ innings. Despite Dwayne
                    Smith’s rapid 29 of just 7 balls to try accelerate his team to something more the West Indies were
                    restricted to 164 for 8 in their 20 overs, a score they must have felt was not enough.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Bangladesh’s innings was made to look easy as Aftab Ahmed and captain Mohammad Ashraful blasted
                    their way though the total with ease never looking like they were in trouble at any stage. Both
                    batsmen manged to keep their team’s run rate above 9 for most of the innings never giving West
                    Indies a chance and winning with 2 whole overs (12 balls) to spare.

                <h4>The Stats</h4>
                <p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Mohammad Ashraful scored the fastest fifty in Twenty20 internationals, beating the previous
                            record held by Sanath Jayasuriya, who scored a 50 off 23 balls against New Zealand in
                            Wellington.</li>
                        <li>
                            Ashraful and Aftab Ahmed were involved in a partnership of 109, the fifth instance of a
                            century partnership in Twenty20 internationals. All five hundred -plus stands have come at
                            the Wanderers.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Syed Rasel's spell of 4-1-10-1 is the most economical for a bowler having delivered four
                            overs in a Twenty20 international. Rasel's economy rate in Twenty20 matches is second-best
                            behind Mark Gillespie.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Shakib Al Hasan's 4 for 34 is the first four-for for a Bangladesh player in a Twenty20
                            international.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Ashraful was at the receiving end while bowling, having conceded 55 runs off his four overs,
                            the second-most runs conceded by a bowler in a Twenty20 international.
                        </li>
