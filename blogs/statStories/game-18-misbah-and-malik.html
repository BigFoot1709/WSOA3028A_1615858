                <h4>The Match</h4>
                <p>
                    Sri Lanka never seemed to be on the ball from the get go tonight as they let loose a quick monster
                    101 run partnership off just 56 balls (run rate of just under 11 runs per over) between Younis Khan
                    and Shoaib Malik during the Pakistan batting innings with 3 of the Sri Lankan going for more then 11
                    runs per over. Pakistanâ€™s lower-order batsmen came in at the end and made matters worse for Sri
                    Lanka with 3 partnerships with strikes rates of 300+.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Then came the great bowling of Pakistan during the Sri Lankan innings to subdue to record breaking
                    batsmen to 33 runs short of the score needed. With 3 bowlers going for less then 6 runs an over.
                    With the last-minute fight from Chaminda Vaas and Tillakaratne Dilshan proving to no reward with
                    Shahid Afridi showing leg spinning greatest to take 3 wickets that gave the Sri Lankas now chance.
                    The game would see Pakistan through to the Semi-Finals of the World Cup.
