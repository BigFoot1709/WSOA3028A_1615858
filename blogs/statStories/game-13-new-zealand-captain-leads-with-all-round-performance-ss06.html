                <h4>The Warm-Up</h4>
                <p>
                    The first of the Super Eight stage matches to take place at the Wanderers transpired earlier today
                    with a very young New Zealand side vs the powerhouse India who had not lost a game from their group
                    stage up until today.
                </p>

                <h4>The Match</h4>
                <p>
                    A breezy 45 from Brendon McCullum had laid the foundation for the New Zealand innings with an
                    quick-fire 44 (off 23 balls) and 35 (off 15) from Craig McMillan and Jacob Oram respectively
                    accelerated some lower-order runs to help the side to a healthy 190 run score – an almost standard
                    score at the Wanderers. Daniel Vettori’s innings of 15 off just 5 balls (at a strike rate of 300!)
                    cannot be forgotten as it turned out to help the side immensely.
                </p>
                <p>
                    India’s openers Gautam Gambhir and Virender Sehwag were making it look easy at the beginning of the
                    Indian innings with an opening partnership of 76 runs just off 35 balls going at a huge run rate of
                    13.02 New Zealand had to find an answer quickly. After Jacob Oram got the wicket of Virender Sehwag
                    for 40 off 17 (strike rate of 235.29) the Indian side seemed to have lost all power. Daniel Vettori
                    was showing a masterclass of left arm slow bowling taking 4 wickets for just 20 runs off his 4 overs
                    of bowling (with an economy of just 5 runs per over). With Vettori ripping through the Indian side
                    they would find themselves 10 runs short with a score of just 180 in their 20 overs. Daniel Vettori
                    was deservedly the Man of the Match today performing in all areas of the game with 4 wickets, a
                    quick 15 runs with the bat, effecting a great run-out and a simple catch – definitely the deciding
                    factor that secured New Zealand victory today.
