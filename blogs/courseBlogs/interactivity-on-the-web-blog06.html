                <h4>
                    What is Interactivity?
                </h4>
                <p>
                    Across the variety of fields concerned with interactivity, such as computer science, human-computer
                    interaction, communication, and industrial design there is still some sort of disagreement over the
                    definition of the term interactivity. One thing they all seem to agree on is that there is
                    definitely some sort of relation to the process of the interaction in some way of humans with
                    computers and/or other machines and their user interfaces.
                    Another definition of interactivity from Margaret Rouse on WhatIs.com - In computers, interactivity
                    is the dialog that occurs between a human being (or possibly any other live creature/animal) and a
                    computer program.

                    Interactivity in Web Design
                </h4>
                <p>
                    An interactive web design is the design of a website/webpage that allows for a more enhanced user
                    experience of interaction between the user and the site/page though the user of different inbuilt
                    features and software. Where personalized data is displayed or presented to users that have asked
                    for it or have needed it through the process of said users interacting with the website/webpage.
                </p>

                <h4>
                    Benefits of Interactivity
                </h4>
                <p>
                    In the field of learning, interactivity strategies utilize a variety of training/teaching software’s
                    that allow employees or students of any type to explore their learning environment and most
                    importantly their field of work at a much more enhanced level. Another benefit of interactivity in
                    learning is that students and employees can learn in their own way and at a pace that is comfortable
                    for them as well as receive almost instance feedback on their progress that allows them to reflect
                    on their own decision making, also allowing trainers/teachers the ability to assess the performance
                    of their learners.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In Interactive Web Design visitors/users have a more personal experience through the ability to
                    customize their data that they see. A benefit of this may see the website gain more visitors over
                    time and thus in turn also enables the website creator to gain more feasible feedback from their
                    users and allows for more improvement. An automated website also saves a lot of time and money when
                    a company’s employees are not around to help visitors/users, instead users have access to
                    information provided at all times.
