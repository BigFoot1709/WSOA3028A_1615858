                <h4>What is Digital Divide?</h4>
                <p>
                    In recent times the interaction between peoples, computers and the internet has seen an increase in
                    information and growth throughout the world. The need for the ability to access this wealth of
                    information has become vastly important for everyone in order to keep up with these current times of
                    rapid technological innovations.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The term “Digital Divide” refers the issue around the differing
                    amount of information or access to information between individuals or countries who have access to
                    computers and/or the internet such as the wealthy, middle-class, and young portion of the population
                    and those underprivileged who do not have access; such as the poor, rural, elderly, and handicapped
                    portion of the population.

                <h4>A Few Factors causing the Digital Divide and its Impact</h4>
                <h5>Geographical Restrictions</h5>
                <p>
                    Less developed countries with weaker economies lack technology and infrastructure that prevents them
                    from setting up high-speed internet connections for its population. Some areas lack a strong
                    infrastructure more then others which contributes to the divide. “In-country geographical
                    restrictions also widen the digital divide. Urban regions are more likely to have access to 4G or
                    fibre optic internet than rural or mountainous zones.” (Steele, 2020)
                </p>
                <h5>Education</h5>
                <p>
                    The hugely different levels of education between individuals widen the digital inequality gap.
                    “College degree holders are perceived to be 10X more likely to tap into the full potential of the
                    internet and computers in their day to day lives compared to individuals with high school education
                    or lower.” (Steele, 2020)
                </p>
                <p>
                    Due to the divide some educational places cannot provide its students with a rich library of
                    information and therefore the learning of advanced skills, academic success and excellent scientific
                    research cannot take place.
                </p>
                <h5>Income</h5>
                <p>
                    In direct connection with education, the differing levels of household incomes across countries and
                    areas have a huge effect on widening the digital gap. For the low-income population money is put
                    towards basic essentials such as food, water, and housing foremost where technology such as
                    computers and the internet is seen as a luxury. “High-income earners ($75,000 – R1,2mil) are 20X
                    more likely to access the internet than low-income earners ($30,000 – R500k).” (Steele, 2020)
                </p>
                <p>
                    Telecommunication services get a much-needed boost to the economic growth of countries, where wide
                    use of internet and technology provides productiveness within a country. With the divide this is
                    made difficult.
