                <h4>The Why and How</h4>
                <p>
                    Steven Stat the stats guy who reports on cricket games. I choose to do Steven Stat as my character
                    for this project because of a multitude of reason that I will list below.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Firstly, the stats (Obviously! It is in his name!), I am a nerd and I am a nut for statistics,
                    numbers, and such (hints
                    being an engineer). I thought this would be an awesome opportunity to make some cool displays of
                    numbers and graphs to display some sort of information. So, I had to think of something I enjoy
                    engaging with and something to do with Johannesburg, South Africa and numbers and stats – So,
                    Cricket! I originally had the idea of basing my website around the 2003 Cricket World Cup that
                    happened here in South Africa but I struggled to find any decent footage of the games that happened
                    here in Johannesburg as well as the fact that those games were ODIs and would have taken longer to
                    analyse and scan for some decent stats (plus we don’t really want to remember the 2003 Cricket World
                    Cup as South Africans). So, I chose to cover the 2007 T20 Cricket World Cup because the games were
                    much shorter, and I could analyse them quicker plus everyone loves T20 Cricket because it is a
                    little bit more exciting. Another reason I chose cricket and tried to find footage was so I could
                    learn to edit and put some videos together for the website, thought it was a cool opportunity to
                    create and edit some videos that could be displayed not only just images.
                </p>
                <p>
                    That is the easy part of covering something that happened in the past, it has already happened. I go
                    and analyse each match cricket match that took place at the Wanderers Stadium in Johannesburg and
                    look out for standout performances or cool events and display the numbers and graphs behind the game
                    as well as a typed analyse of the events that made the cricket game’s result the way it was. Create
                    short highlight packages in the form of video of the games to give readers a perspective of the game
                    how it was back then. My goal is to try and have fun with the idea and learn some new things (such
                    as editing videos, images, databases) along the way.
                </p>
