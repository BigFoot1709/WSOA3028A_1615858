                <h4>What is Fama.io?</h4>
                <p>
                    Named from a Latin term translated to “Fame via reputation”. Fama Technologies is a tech company
                    using artificial intelligence to help weed out problematic employees before they are even hired by
                    an organization.
                </p>
                <p>
                    “Fama provides an automated solution that identifies problematic behaviour among potential hires and
                    current employees by analysing publicly available online information. Enterprise HR and Talent
                    leaders trust Fama to help identify behaviours such as bigotry and harassment that are often missed
                    in the hiring process. With Fama, organizations can now improve workplace culture and protect their
                    employees from harassment and toxic behaviours before they escalate to more serious concerns and
                    expose the brand to liability.” From <a href="http://www.fama.io.">http://www.fama.io.</a>

                <h4>Thoughts</h4>
                <p>
                    "Fama analyzes a candidate or current employee’s digital footprint through their publicly available
                    online data, with the goal of identifying any potential risks posed to the organization, which could
                    include bigotry, sexism, and harassment." (Onesto 2020)
                </p>
                <p>
                    While it should be the number one goal of businesses and organizations to have a comfortable and
                    safe working environment for all of their employees, at what lengths would you go to make sure of
                    that? Investing in an AI that spots bad ones out before you even hire them perhaps? While this would
                    seem like a simple and desirable solution at first you have to wonder what the AI’s guild lines are
                    based off. What are the traits that they are looking for that give employees the red light? We hope
                    that the algorithms and designs used by Fama are unbiased and in the right way for finding
                    undesirable employees. Hopefully, employees with a red light do have an opportunity to redeem or
                    explain themselves from what they might done or posted in their past online and not be able to ever
                    apply again.
