                <em>Livestreaming is one the most popular forms of entertainment on the web today, be it for news,
                    education, business, social media or for the most popular multi-billion dollar form of media: video
                    games.</em>
            </p>
            <h4>History of Twitch</h4>
            <p>
                Twitch launched back in 2011 under the development of founder Justin Kan. Justin was studying for a
                physics and psychology degree at Yale back in 2005 when he founded a start-up called justin.tv, a
                website where users could create channels and live stream video content called ‘broadcasts’ to other
                user logged on to watch called ‘viewers’. Over the next 7 years the website would evolve and grow
                gaining features such as Categories and Headlines where broadcasters could distinguish themselves from
                others. In 2011 justin.tv separated its ‘Gaming” section into a new website, called Twitch where shortly
                after all the other sections such as Sports, Music, News and People were moved too.

            <p>Some mind-blowing stats from Twitch that might amaze you. <em>(Stats taken January 3rd, 2020)</em>
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Twitch Has More Than 15 Million Daily Active Users</li>
                <li>Twitch has between 2.2 and 3.2 Million Broadcasters each month.</li>
                <li>Over 726 million hours are watched per month, that’s just over 24 million hours a day.</li>
                <li>Twitch has 75,6% share of all hours watched on all live-broadcasting platforms on the web, that’s
                    including other platforms such as YouTube and Facebook.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Effects on Education</h4>
            <p>
                Whether it’s a student learning how to code or someone learning how to cook something new there is a
                huge variety of learning opportunities that live broadcasting brings. Live broadcasting also plays an
                important role in delivering distance education for students who may live in inaccessible areas or be
                very useful in helping students who can’t attend a traditional school. Live broadcasting can also be
                used to discuss sensitive topics without the uncomfortable person-to-person discussion that many people
                can’t handle.
            </p>
            <h4>Effects on Video Games and Game Development</h4>
            <p>
                The growth and accessibility of Twitch has changed the way some video games are being created. Video
                games with new engaging experiences have popped up recently which have extended the gameplay and turned
                viewers into active participants in the video game – games such as Drawful or the JackBox Party Pack
                allow viewers to make and submit content that gets loaded into the game. Video games with more
                compelling and complex stories are much more popular for viewers as they are watching the gameplay
                instead of actually playing. Twitch also allows smaller lesser know games to be seen by a much larger
                audience which in turn drives the development of the video games further with more sales.
