                <h4>What is a browser?</h4>
                <p>
                    A browser (or sometimes referred to a web browser or Internet browser) is a software program used to
                    access or explore pieces of content on the internet. These pieces of content come in all forms such
                    as
                    pictures, videos or documents all displayed on webpages within websites. A browser goes and receives
                    these websites and webpages from online servers and displays them to the user who needs to access
                    the
                    internet.
                </p>
                <h4>Short history of the browser</h4>
                <p>
                    The first browser, called WorldWideWeb, was created by a British computer scientist Sir Tim
                    Berners-Lee
                    at CERN (European Organization for Nuclear Research) back in 1989. The most common browsers used
                    today
                    by almost everyone who accesses the internet on a daily basis are ones such as Microsoft Edge,
                    Mozilla
                    Firefox, Google Chrome, Apple Safari or Opera.
                </p>
                <h4>How does a browser work?</h4>
                <p>
                    When you type a webpage address (or Uniform Resource Locator (URL)) such as www.google.com into your
                    browser, it is sometimes assumed that the entire webpage is stored on a server somewhere complete
                    and
                    ready to be downloaded and sent back to our browser and then displayed to us. Where in reality you
                    are
                    actually calling up a variety of different requests for different types of content stored in
                    different
                    locations, such as various directories or multiple servers, to be displayed on that webpage. A
                    browser
                    makes a list of some sorts to fetch and load all the small parts of content from the various
                    locations
                    and combines (or renders) them all to display a full webpage. The worlds first website is still
                    online
                    and can be found here.
                </p>
                <h4>Hyperlinks and cache</h4>
                <p>
                    Webpages usually contain hyperlinks to other webpages, where each link contains its or address
                    (URL).
                    When these hyperlinks are clicked (or tapped on a phone), the browser will navigate to this new
                    resource
                    where the process of loading all the content needed for that webpage begins again. Most browser will
                    use
                    an internal cache of webpage resources stored on your computer to help improve loading times when
                    you
                    visit certain webpages . The cache can store large content items such as images or videos so that
                    they
                    do not need to be downloaded from the server again.
