                    The web and internet have become an integral part of almost everyone’s daily lives and both continue
                    to grow more each day. Making sure that a website or webpage can be interacted and experienced by
                    most people if not all does not only allow it to be seen by a much larger audience but will also
                    help in the development of a better and improved web and making the web accessible for everyone.
                </p>
                <h4>
                    What is Web Accessibility?
                </h4>
                <p>
                    Accessibility means the ability for everyone to have access to something regardless of their
                    condition or circumstance. Wikipedia says, “Accessibility refers to the design of products,
                    devices, services, or environments for people who experience disabilities.”. So, we say that Web
                    Accessibility is a way of designing the web or internet in such a way that makes it accessible for
                    everyone regardless of their circumstance or disabilities. Everyone needs to perceive, experience,
                    understand and interact with the web so that they can, in turn, contribute to the Web just as
                    everyone who has before them – this will only lead to more improved web.
                </p>
                <h4>
                    Why Web Accessibility is Important?
                </h4>
                <p>
                    The usage of web and internet today is an extremely important part of people’s everyday life be it
                    in education, work, health care, security, banking or entertainment. Therefore, is it important that
                    the web be accessible to everyone to provide equal opportunity to people with disabilities and allow
                    them to participate in everyday society. So, it is always important to have web accessibility in
                    mind with designing and building websites.
