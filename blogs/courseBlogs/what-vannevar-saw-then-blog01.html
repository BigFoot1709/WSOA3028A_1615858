                Pointing out some of the things today around us that Vannevar Bush kind of predicted in a sense.
            </p>

            <h4>"Store human writings in a small room with the use of photography and microfilm"</h4>
            <p>
                Today writings are photocopied, scanned, or photographed and stored online in folders on servers of
                computers. Today data is stored on the smallest of devices and is continuously getting smaller compared
                to the technology of the pass where computers would take up entire rooms and even buildings.
            </p>
            <h4>"Speech recording and stenography"</h4>
            <p>
                Speech recording with phones – voice messages. The use of Speech Recognition and Natural Language
                Processing such as Siri on the Apple iPhones or Alexa on the Amazon Echo. Stenography is the quicker
                process of writing in shorthand and then later transcribing the shorthand on a typewriter. Today there
                are applications that allow users to scribble something on their phone, tablet or laptop and their
                scribble is translated to text input. Autocorrect would even be a form of this as the user only has to
                enter in a short part of a much larger word in order to complete the phase they need to enter.
            </p>
            <h4>"Printing immediate"</h4>
            <p>
                Today printing is pretty immediate – documents, images, books, or reports can be printed quickly using
                today high-end printer with some outputting as much as 50 pages per minute. As well as the advancement
                of being able to print three dimensional objects today.
            </p>
            <h4>“The main feature of the memex is the ability to tie two things together at will. In other words, to be
                able to associate two arbitrary items when wanted. The user is also able to build a trail, in which they
                name it, insert a name into the code book, and then taps it out on the keyboard. At any time, the user
                is able to view two items at the same time, parallel viewing. It is also possible to pass items to
                another memex.”</h4>
            <p>
                Sounds and reads exactly like the internet and the use of search engines where any term or item can be
                inserted into the “search bar”. Google has the ability to search by images. The trail between these
                items is similar to the hyperlinking between pages on a web browser.
            </p>
            <h4>“The trails made can be shared with others and can also be published, like an encyclopaedia. Soon we
                will be able to establish some kind of direct connection with absorbing material of the record with one
                of our senses, tactilely, orally, and visually.”</h4>
            <p>
                Social media – where almost anything, such as images, locations, videos etc., can be shared with other
                people who have access to the internet. Most things we seen and access on the internet we are absorbing
                both visually and audibly with computers and screens, as well as tactilely through touch screens on
                modern phones and note pads.
