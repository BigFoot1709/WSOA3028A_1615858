            <h4>"Store human writings in a small room with the use of photography and microfilm"</h4>
            <p>
                Today writings are photocopied, scanned or photographed and stored online in folders on servers of
                computers.

            <h4>"Speech recording and stenography"</h4>
            <p>
                Speech recording with phones – voice messages. Stenography is the quicker process of writing in
                shorthand and then later transcribing the shorthand on a typewriter. Today there are applications that
                allow users to scribble something on their phone, tablet or laptop and their scribble is translated to
                text input. Autocorrect would even be a form of this as the user only has to enter in a short part of a
                much larger word in order to complete the phase they need to enter.
            </p>

            <p>
                Today printing is pretty immediate – documents, images, books or reports can be printed quickly using
                today high-end printer with some outputting as much as 50 pages per minute.
            </p>
            <h4>"The advancement of photography is not going to stop"</h4>
            <p>
                The advancement of digital image resolution today is a non-stop train growing moving day to day.
