                <h4>What is Implicit Bias?</h4>
                <p>
                    “Also known as implicit social cognition, implicit bias refers to the attitudes or stereotypes that
                    affect our understanding, actions, and decisions in an unconscious manner. These biases, which
                    encompass both favourable and unfavourable assessments, are activated involuntarily and without an
                    individual’s awareness or intentional control. Residing deep in the subconscious, these biases are
                    different from known biases that individuals may choose to conceal for the purposes of social and/or
                    political correctness.”
                </p>
                <p>
                    These implicit assessments we make in our own subconscious can cause us to have certain views and
                    standpoints about various aspects of life such as events, people, or opinions. When it comes to
                    people with implicit assessments, we have certain attitudes other people based on normal
                    characteristics such as race, ethnicity, age, and appearance. These associations or assessments are
                    learnt and developed in everyone from a young age through the course of a lifetime through a variety
                    things such as early life experiences, close family and friends who you grew up with, the media or
                    the news.

                <h4>Implicit Gender Bias in Software Development</h4>
                <p>
                    92.1% of the 26,000 programmer respondents to Stack Overflow's 2015 developer survey were identified
                    as male; only 5.8 percent identified as female. (The remaining respondents either chose "other" or
                    declined to answer.) In an era where technology is used everyday for almost everything and is
                    constantly growing from day to day, building software today demands a design where constant change
                    is possible. Technology and software being built needs to consider how it will be used by a diverse
                    group of consumers for it to be successful, everyone needs to be able to use it effectively. It is
                    important that women have a louder voice then they do now and the equal opportunity to shape what is
                    being built and how it will shape the world.
