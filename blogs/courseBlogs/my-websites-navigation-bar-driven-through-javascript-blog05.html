                    <img src="..\..\Images\java1-blog.PNG" alt="The required html code needed to run the navigation bar (seen in the image above) from

                <p>
                    The above navigation bar along with its html code needs to appear on every page on this website.
                    These 17 lines of html code needed to be copy and pasted on every home page in the website’s file
                    directory (The Home Page, The About Page and The Contact Page). A different set of 17 lines were
                    needed for all the course blog pages and another set for all the StatStory pages. This was getting
                    pretty messy and clumsy when trying to work when crating new webpages as these 17 lines were needed
                    on every page. So, after learning DOM Manipulation through JS I was able to create some sort of
                    solution to this problem.
                </p>

                <h4>
                    After JavaScript
                </h4>

                <figure align="center">
                    <img src="..\..\Images\java2-blog.PNG" alt="The reduced html code needed to run the navigation bar with JavaScript from
                    this blog webpage." width="700">
                    <figcaption> The reduced html code needed to run the navigation bar with JavaScript from
                        this blog webpage.
                    </figcaption>
                </figure>

                <p>
                    So, if I created a single empty section tag on the page in html (1 single line of code) I could edit
                    it with a JS script (the second single line of code). With the JavaScript file
                    <em>blogs_navbar.js</em> only 2 lines of html need to be copied onto every
                    webpage.
                </p>

                <figure align="center">
                    <img src="..\..\Images\java4-blog.PNG" alt="The JavaScript file. The contents of blogs_navbar.js."
                        width="800">
                    <figcaption> The JavaScript file. The contents of <em>blogs_navbar.js</em>.
                    </figcaption>
                </figure>

                <p>
                    In the above displayed JS file, I get the empty section tag out of the html document and change its
                    inner content. The new inner content of the empty section becomes the original 17 lines of html code
                    I used previously – I combine them all into 1 single string with the .join() command in JS. I am
                    therefore creating the navigation bar in a small package of sorts. I then
                    have 1 JS file per set of navigation lines I need for the different pages of my website (home pages,
                    blog pages and statstory pages). I can then use the respective JS file I need and put 2 lines of
                    code for my navigation bar and not need to worry about links not finding pages.
