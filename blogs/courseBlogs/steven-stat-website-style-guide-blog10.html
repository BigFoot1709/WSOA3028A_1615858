            <h4>
                Reasons Behind Design Decisions
            </h4>

            <p>
                The colour palette I chose had the colours displayed above to try and match that of modern coding
                environment/console but at the same time try and have a retro old school kind of feel to it. The
                character’s stories are about stats and numbers so I thought of having that computer feel would go well
                with the numbers playing displayed. With a darker heavier background to surround the much lighter
                coloured numbers to make them stand out more.
            </p>
            <p>
                The font style I chose has the name Roboto and I chose it because I thought it had a clean cut and easy
                to read feel to it and was great for headings and text in the body text example. Easy readability in
                larger paragraphs would be seen with this font style. The bold and italic styles of the font also have a
                clean cut to it and make for easy readability but still at the same time have their demarcations clear.
                Headings for blogs/stories will be located in more central positions in the future to catch the eye a
                bit more. Blog/story titles on the home page will also be changed in the future to effect more “popping
                out” to the user with the scale and emphasis of the heading being changed.
            </p>
            <p>
                For the buttons I thought it would be a good idea to make sure the buttons animate in colour change when
                the user interacts with them in some way (such as hovering over them or click on them with the mouse) to
                give a little more interaction with the website. I also plan for all buttons on the website to be the
                same design and exact size as to not create too much bias between them. Buttons will be used mainly in
                navigation around the beside such as in the navigation bar for example. The navigation bar will be more
                structured in the future with more balance and alignment with the other elements of the website being
                displayed.

                    Original Wireframes for Planned Future Site Development

                <p>
                    Below are the original planned wireframes for the Steven Stat website, including the layouts
                    for the
                    different pages of the website such as the Home page, Page of Blogs or StatStories and the
                    individual blog pages.
