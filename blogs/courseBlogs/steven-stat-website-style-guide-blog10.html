            <h4>
                Reasons Behind Design Decisions
            </h4>

            <p>
                The colour palette I chose had the colours displayed above to try and match that of modern coding
                environment/console but at the same time try and have a retro old school kind of feel to it. The
                character’s stories are about stats and numbers so I thought of having that computer feel would go well
                with the numbers playing displayed. With a darker heavier background to surround the much lighter
                coloured numbers to make them stand out more.
            </p>
            <p>
                The font style I chose has the name Roboto and I chose it because I thought it had a clean cut and easy
                to read feel to it and was great for headings and text in the body text example. Easy readability in
                larger paragraphs would be seen with this font style. The bold and italic styles of the font also have a
                clean cut to it and make for easy readability but still at the same time have their demarcations clear.
                Headings for blogs/stories will be located in more central positions in the future to catch the eye a
                bit more. Blog/story titles on the home page will also be changed in the future to effect more “popping
                out” to the user with the scale and emphasis of the heading being changed.
            </p>
            <p>
                For the buttons I thought it would be a good idea to make sure the buttons animate in colour change when
                the user interacts with them in some way (such as hovering over them or click on them with the mouse) to
                give a little more interaction with the website. I also plan for all buttons on the website to be the
                same design and exact size as to not create too much bias between them. Buttons will be used mainly in
                navigation around the beside such as in the navigation bar for example. The navigation bar will be more
                structured in the future with more balance and alignment with the other elements of the website being
                displayed.

                    Original Wireframes for Planned Future Site Development
                </h3>
                <p>
                    Below are the original planned wireframes for the Steven Stat website, including the layouts
                    for the
                    different pages of the website such as the Home page, Page of Blogs or StatStories and the
                    individual blog pages.

                <h3>
                    Reflection on changed Designs from Wireframes and Style Guide
                </h3>
                <p>
                    From the displayed style guide and planned wireframes from above I think most of the planned designs
                    were implemented. The main font used everywhere on the website works very well as a very easy to
                    read font and works well for headings. Most of the colours from the colour palette were used with
                    the green (#428C3F) not being used as through the building of the website it did not feel like it
                    would fit anywhere. Simplified buttons were used as seen as they are now on the website as the
                    detailed buttons in the style guide were too detailed to fit on the website as it is now. It was
                    also decided to make the background of the website for all pages a much darker blue then planned as
                    it gave the website a more “dark theme” to be easier on the eye.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For the wireframes, through the building of the website the general layout of the planned wireframes
                    was followed with small details being missed due to lack of time. For example, the side bars on the
                    wireframes for the Blogs/StatStories Pages and the Individual Blogs/StatStories Pages were
                    originally planned for ads of some type that would fit the idea of the personal website, but we not
                    used. As well as the planned list of other blogs and StatStories on the left of the wireframe for
                    the Individual Blogs/StatStories Pages not being used. The closed implemented pages to their
                    original plans have to be the Home Page and the Blogs/StatStories Pages. It was through the actual
                    building and making of the website where plans where changed through the trying of new and different
                    things to see if it would stick.
